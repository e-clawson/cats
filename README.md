# About 

    Cat site is an SPA that utilizes TheCatAPI to display images of cats, information and images of cats by breed, and a list of your favorited cat images. 

    For this project, we were required to make an SBA that fetches data from an external API. I originally decided to keep my project simple and fun by making an art site that uses the Art Institute of Chicago's API (AIC API - https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction). This seemed like a good API to use for this project especially because it has thorough and clear documentation, which should make for a more seamless project in the short timeline available. However, the documentation for post requests was outdated and it was unclear whether post requests were still possible. I had wanted to use an API other than the ones we had already used in class or for other projects, but I ended up using the CAT API since it has very clear user documentation for many types of requests, and I wanted to show I was capable of more than GET requests. 

# Installation 

# Reflection 

- What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

- Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

- What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

- Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.

# SBA 308A: 
JavaScript Web Application
Version 1.0, 08/18/23
https://www.canva.com/design/DAFtDB2xfOk/xEpMguB7x3VPSkrx3KaJgw/edit

# Introduction
This assessment measures your capability to implement advanced JavaScript tools and features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.

This assessment has a total duration of two (2) days. This is a take-home assessment.
You have two total days (including weekends and holidays) to work on this assessment. This assessment will be due at 5:00pm on the second day after it is assigned. Your instructor may provide you with class time to work on the assessment, schedule permitting.

Assignment due - Tuesday, September 3, 8:00am(EST)

# Objectives
    - Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
    - Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop
    - Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
    - Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
    - Organize files using modules and imports.

# Submission
Submit the link to your completed assessment using the Start Assignment button on the Assignment page in Canvas.

# Instructions
You will create a small single-page web application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!

Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.

Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.

Once you have an idea in mind, approach your design through the user's perspective. User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design. If users enjoy their time on with your application, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and use the application again in the future.

You will need access to an external API in order to complete the requirements listed below. Since the content of the API will largely determine the content of your application, it should be chosen first and carefully. You can look for available APIs across the internet, but make sure they include features that will allow you to implement the requirements listed below.

Click here for a list of free APIs you can use (https://free-apis.github.io/#/browse). Two of our favorites, which contain all of the features necessary for this assessment are The Cat API and The Dog API. You are not limited to these APIs or any others in the list above. Feel free to get creative! 

# Requirements
The requirements listed here are absolute minimums. Ensure that your application meets these requirements before attempting to further expand your features.
Create your application locally, and initialize a local git repo. Make frequent commits to the repo. When your application is complete, push your repo to GitHub and submit the link to the GitHub page using the submission instructions at the top of this document.

# Requirements (list)
- Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your applicationâ€™s content and features. (20%)

    - Using TheCatAPI (https://thecatapi.com/) - used a fetch request in index.js line 8 to get images of cats to populate the homepage 

- Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.(15%)

    - added a filter feature that uses a GET request to populate the dropdown menu with a list of cats, and a get request to select the images and information of the selected cat breed based on the id. 

- Enable user manipulation of data within the API through the use of POST, PUT, or PATCH requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this feature before beginning.(15%)

    -favoriteimg feature which allows users to click a favorite button and add that image to their favorites cat page, and delete cats from their favroites page 

- Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate. (15%)
    - done in the initialLoad function in index.js (line 7)
    - done in the BreedInfo function in filter.js (line 38)

- Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary. (3%)
    1. index.js - js file containting the function for the initial load of cat images for the homepage
    2. filter.js - file containing the fucntion for the filter feature that filters cats by breed and displays information and images pertaining to that breed only
    3. favorites.js - file containing the function for the favroites feature 

- Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.). (5%)
    - so far so good

- Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS. (5%)

- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit). (10%)

- Commit frequently to the git repository. (5%)
   

- Include a README file that contains a description of your application. (2%)
    - please see above readme 

- Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience. (5%)
